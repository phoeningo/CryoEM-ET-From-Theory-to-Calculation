Particle stacks contain a X*Y*Z shape image, where X*Y is your particle size and Z means how many particles are there in a stack. Usually one micrograph own one particle stack.
In most software, a specific particle is accessed like this : 000014@particle_stack_name.mrc(s).

Only .mrcs suffix is supported in RELION while both .mrc and .mrcs are allowed in cryoSPARC. But the default format cryoSPARC use is .mrc .

If you need to link .mrc to .mrcs files in your 'Particle Extraction' directory, 'cd' to your extract where your can find your particles using 'ls ' command.Then run this scripts:
#===================
for mrc in `ls *.mrc`
do
mrcs=${mrc/mrc/mrcs}
ln -s $mrc $mrcs
done
#===================

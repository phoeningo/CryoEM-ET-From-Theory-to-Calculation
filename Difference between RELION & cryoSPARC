This doc mainly discusses differences between RELION and cryoSPARC.

1. The coordinate system:
    Take an image shaped of (3838,3710) as example.
    In relion it's also recognized as (3838,3710). And the coordinate (0,0) means the ________ corner. 
    In cryoSPARC it's recognized as (3710,3838). And the coordinate (0,0) means the ________ corner. 
    
    If you import particles in cryoSPARC Import Job, the coordinates are converted according to this formula:
    
    new_coord_x,new_coord_y = old_coord_y/ Y *X ,old_coord_x/ X *Y
